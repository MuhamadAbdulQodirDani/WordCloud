# Project Overview
The project analyzes data related to a YouTube channel, "Nabawi TV," by visualizing the data using word clouds. The primary aim is to explore and present word frequency from specific comments or text data found within the dataset. The analysis involves processing the textual data, creating a word cloud to highlight the most common words, and providing a graphical representation of the insights.
# Data Overview
We take data from an Indonesian youtube channel, namely Nabawi Tv. This data includes various attributes such as video titles, ids, number of shows and others.
# Tools Used
Visual Studio Code
Google Spreadshet
# Conclusion
The notebook culminates in generating a word cloud from the text in the dataset, which helps visualize the most frequent words. The word cloud offers an intuitive, visually engaging way to identify key themes or topics that are most prominent in the YouTube channel's content or audience interaction.
# Recomendation
Deeper Analysis: Besides generating a word cloud, deeper text analysis (e.g., sentiment analysis or topic modeling) could provide more insight into the content or audience engagement on Nabawi TV.
